Persona is a beloved franchise for a lot of people, but if you were to take a survey of the majority of gamers, most wouldn't know what it is. For a lot of people, Persona falls into that niche, but no so niche anymore, genre of JRPGs. Now that video games have become a bigger part of everyday life, people's interest in certain genres has expanded and therefore games like Persona have become more popular in places that they weren't necessarily developed for. I have never been to Japan, but I can play a game that models a persons everyday life in Japan. Well, maybe besides the demons.

To start this journey, I picked up a copy of Persona 4 Golden for my Playstation Vita. I figured that if I were to start somewhere, I might as well start with the game that every proclaims as their favorite and the one that got them hooked. As soon as the game loaded, I was met with what felt like an intro movie for a Japanese version of an American 90s high school sitcom. Characters doing something crazy for the camera, all the while an upbeat tune plays over the top. And from playing a few hours, that's what this game feels like. The protagonist, Yu, is the new kid in school who joins a rag-tag group of kids set on figuring out the town's mysteries. To do this, they enter another dimension through their TV every night and talk to a bear named Teddie who helps them navigate to save their townsfolk. In order to do this, they must harness their Persona powers(basically Pokemon) to fight these Shadows which are attacking people. 

The game is broken up into days, which are broken up further into generic times of the day(Morning, Early Afternoon, Evening). As you play through the game, you have to focus on the weather and the time of day to complete certain tasks or extra-curricular activities. And yes, they are actual extra-curricular activities, such as the basketball club and drama club. Joining these clubs and participating in them benfits Yu with skill increases or Social Links, which changes how he performs in battle. Basically, you have to figure out how to get the most out of your high school experience so that you can be better at saving the town.

I'm only about 10 hours into Persona 4 Golden so far, and expect at least another 70 hours out of it, but I feel like I have a firm grasp on what this game wants me to do by the time it's all over. Instead of doing what other games do, and throwing me into a party of people that I don't care about or know that well, it wants me to develop relationships with the cast of characters. The fighting, Persona-collecting and dungeon crawling are all extra pieces of what is shaping up to be an adventure with characters that you actually care about.
