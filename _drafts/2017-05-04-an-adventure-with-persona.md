Persona is a beloved franchise for a lot of people, but if you were to take a survey of the majority of gamers, most wouldn't know what it is. For a lot of people, Persona falls into that niche, but no so niche anymore, genre of JRPGs. Now that video games have become a bigger part of everyday life, people's interest in certain genres has expanded and therefore games like Persona have become more popular in places that they weren't necessarily developed for. I have never been to Japan, but I can play a game that models a persons everyday life in Japan. Well, maybe besides the demons.

To start this journey, I picked up a copy of Persona 4 Golden for my Playstation Vita. I figured that if I were to start somewhere, I might as well start with the game that every proclaims as their favorite and the one that got them hooked. As soon as the game came up, I was met with what felt like an intro movie for a Japanese version of an American 90s high school sitcom. Characters doing something crazy for the camera, all the while an upbeat tune plays over the top. And from playing a few hours, that's what this game feels like. The protagonist, Yu, is the new kid in school and immediately upon going to school, he joins a rag-tag group of kids who are set on figuring out the town's mysteries. To do this, they enter another dimension through their TV every night and talk to a bear named Teddie who helps them navigate to save their townsfolk. In order to do this, they must harness their Persona powers(basically Pokemon) to fight these Shadows which are attacking people. 

These mysteries are the deaths of significant figures around the city, and it all seems to fall back on a parallel universe eating people from the inside out. The high schoolers have put themselves in charge of investigating these murders, and in doing so, they end up saving a few people along the way. The game seems to be focused on social connections and the scheduling of Yu's everyday life so that he can be prepared to fight Shadows and save lives, but the overall gameplay feels like it's part visual novel, and part dungeon crawler. 

I'm only about 10 hours into Persona 4 Golden so far, and expect at least another 70 hours out of it, but I feel like I have a firm grasp on what this game wants me to do by the time it's all over. Instead of doing what other games do, and throwing me into a party of people that I don't care about or know that well, it wants me to develop relationships with the cast of characters. The fighting, Persona-collecting and dungeon crawling are all extra pieces of what is shaping up to be an adventure with characters that you actually care about.
